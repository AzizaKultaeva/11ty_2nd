    <p class="lead">"I should stand up and fight for people who suffer from pollution", said Vlada Sukhanova, a master's student who covers environmental issues. But the syllabus for the Environmental Reporting course she took as part of her education says: "In this course, we are journalists, not advocates or lobbyists." Environmental reporters are often in dilemma in keeping principles of objectivism and neutrality, and how are MSU student reporters steering?</p> 
    
    <p class="lead">The social and journalistic role of environmental journalists is a hotly debated topic in journalism studies as well as among practitioners. Many researchers found role inconsistencies in individual journalists. At the same time, environmental journalists differ from each other too in taking a particular journalistic role, and researchers Tandoc Jr, E. C., & Takahashi, B. (2014) said it is expected if their roles conflict.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">Environmental Student Reporters of MSU</h2>
    <p>"That semester when I was in the environmental journalism class, I have published at least six or seven stories which looked so good," said Cassidy Hough, Senior at MSU School of Journalism with a minor in Environmental Science. She is so glad to find the intersection between two favorites: science and reporting about it.</p>
    <p>"Our articles are published not only on the Great Lakes Echo website but also in local newspapers," said Vlada Sukhanovskaya, master's student at MSU School of Journalism with environmental and health journalism concentration. "We cover a lot of problems in the Great Lakes region across the eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. It is great, I love this job." There are many student reporters who are enthusiastic about the environment and publish in the Great Lake Echo environmental site. Kyle Davidson who took environmental courses which synchronized with reporting for Great Lakes Echo said the important knowledge he learned was breaking down and simplifying scientific studies and findings for general readers.</p>
    <p>"I think it is the extremely helpful thing that all journalists should learn," Davidson said. "Because you can apply this general concept in other bits whether you are covering politics, law, or any other complex subject". Some journalists become a reporter for the Great Lake Echo based on their background in science. Jack Armstrong hasn't taken environmental journalism courses, but he has already published many articles.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">Student Reporters' Role Perception</h2>
    <p>During the coverage of those environmental issues, it is hard to stay objective, Shukhanovskaya said. She said journalists become advocates of the environment when governmental agencies do not do enough on regulation and manufactories don't take responsibility. She used the example of Illinois EtO, a type of air pollution when the emission of chemical toxins is higher than allowed.</p>
    <p>"Some areas of Illinois were polluted but regulation was weak and people who live there were hazarded," she said. "I should stand up and fight for people who suffer from pollution." But the syllabus for the Environmental Reporting course she took as part of her education says: "In this course, we are journalists, not advocates or lobbyists. As such, we offer coverage that is fair, balanced, and accurate, and we adhere to high professional ethical standards." Sukhanovskaya said that there are risks of interviewing all sides when trying to be objective. "If in Illinois case I focus on interviewing manufactories, I will just help <em>evil</em> side to push their views on spreading this dangerous chemical that is scientifically proved", Sukhanovskaya said.</p>
    <p>However, Kyle Davidson believes it is possible to stay objective when covering environmental issues. "If you work in environmental journalism, there is an expectation, that you want to be an advocate, fight for the power and safe trees, but that is not necessarily the case for every environmental journalist," said Davidson. The role that he tries to take on is more of an educator. Davidson said: "For example, over the summer I covered the chemical spill into a river that was very close to Milford, Michigan where I am from. It is very personal, but I tried to choose a balance by asking what information people want to know. So, you are trying to effect some changes, but it doesn't necessarily require advocating on behalf environment". When Jack Armstrong decided to enroll in journalism it didn't take him long before he realized that want to do specifically environmental journalism and since then he has been trying to keep journalism's principles. "As a journalist, I am a neutral observer, you try to be objective, and it is what journalists do. But it is hard to write about the environment if you don't care about the environment." Armstrong said when journalists write about disasters, for example, they can give facts and they don't have to be advocates to impact people.</p>
    <p>"I don't see myself as an activist,"" Armstrong said. "But I am doing this because I care about the environment, so a little bit of both, but I define myself more as a journalist to educate people about environmental problems." Cassidy Hough said in educating people about food she should be an advocate because when reporters tell the environmental problem they mostly write about solutions as well. "Especially now when I am doing a podcast about food systems, I would say I am an advocate for things like localizing, where you get your food, eating less meat, and being aware of food wasting," Hough said. She is confident that it is fair to be an advocate in environmental journalism and it is also cool if you can take a standpoint.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">Is Professors' Approach Neutrality?</h2>
    <p>The director of the Knight Center for Environmental Journalism Eric Freedman said the faculty's goal is for students to use skills they learned in classes as professionals would. Despite professor Freedman admitting all new changings and shifts in contemporary journalism, he is one who stressed in the course syllabus the importance of avoiding advocacy:</p>
    <p>Maybe that is just the way I have been doing it since I've begun a long time ago as a reporter. I realize media and the public's approach to media are changed. Not all journalists are trained, some of them picked it up, and some of the are bloggers. Bloggers are usually advocating rather than neutral observers and distillers of different sources tell them or data shows."</p>
    <p>However, he says that society needs both: neutral environmental journalism and advocacy journalism. The Director of the MSU School of Journalism Tim P. Vos has done a lot of research on journalists' social roles. The conclusion he makes from them is how a journalist thinks about their social role is not an immutably exclusive decision that they make. "It is more hybrid," Vos said. "There are times in which they have to step back, be a somewhat detached observer to be able to describe what is going on and what they see". But there are other times where they do step forward and engage the public on the importance of what it is that they are observing, he said. Dr. Vos said: "We cannot expect everyone to be experts on the health of the environment and there are the moments you have to have the public's attention and say you are living, working or playing in the dangerous environment that something drastically wrong here." Dr. Vos said reaching those people takes some persuasion when there is a lot of competition with a lot of things to pay attention to on many different platforms. "That is why sometimes journalists have to raise their voice and change their voice to be more advocate for environmental justice," he said. 
    <p>But Vos believes it is not a binary choice, as modern people live in a hybrid environment where they take different roles and different types. Similarly, the survey conducted by Tandoc Jr, E. C., & Takahashi, B. (2014) with more than 130 environmental journalists showed that they perceive their role differently. The definition of journalistic roles was changing over journalism history. One of the recent definitions was given by Hanitzsch & Vos (2018). They pointed out 18 roles including the most common ones such as advocative, disseminator, educator or analyst journalists which are in the main six divisions: informative-instructive, analytical-deliberative, critical-monitorial and adversary journalists. Dr. Vos noted that the most important question for journalists to ask themselves is what the public needs to know. The role of environmental journalists may change depending on many factors and most of them are in the middle when trying to be objective.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">The Environmental Journalism Program at MSU</h2>
    <p>The MSU School of Journalism has prepared hundreds of professionals for environmental journalism and communication. It is a unique program in quality, as the director of the School of Journalism said. Because the existence of the Knight Center for Environmental Journalism which was founded in 1994 makes the program more in deep than other American journalism schools that offer environmental reporting classes.</p>
    <p>The director of the Knight Center Eric Freedman and two other faculty members teach two types of environmental journalism courses. One is reporting course and the another is a theoretical class for undergraduate and master's students on the environment, science and health journalism. Professor Freedman said they consider the environment broader: "The reporting class focuses on news. It can be public policy news, new scientific or social science studies news. Students will take the scientific paper and make it into a news story, they will be interviewing the people, and they will look at data. Seminar looks at issues more broadly in an academic way, for example, how does press cover climate change or transborder issues where the environmental problem doesn't stop because of the political border."</p> 
    <p>Cassidy Hough, a senior said she could learn a lot about science and how to write about it in classes. "We learned how to read actual scientific articles, where is the important newsworthy stuff, and how to reach out to scientists and how to interview them," Hough said. "Now I know all those things and I have a bunch of local newspapers at home who republished my articles on their front pages". The students who take skill courses should publish news for the Great Lakes Echo website platform which is run by Knight Center and students from theory courses also may do so.</p>
    <p>"Particularly the undergraduate students don't have a lot of reporting experience and most of what they've done so far is covering local government in East Lansing and Lansing area including school boards and city councils," Freedman said. "We are giving them chance to do something geographically broader, we have this Great Lakes basin one of the world's biggest resources of fresh water." Professors said when journalism institution is shrinking and being destabilized, environmental journalism continues to be a priority in news organizations and the students are finding work around the globe and issues to cover.</p>
