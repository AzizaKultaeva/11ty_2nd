    <p class="lead">The chance an international student who majors in journalism to obtain a United States visa Journalism major internationals a thousand times more difficult when compared to their STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) counterparts, as myvisajobs.com shows.</p> 
    
      </section>

    <p>Kaishi Chhabra, a journalism major from India graduated a couple of years ago from Michigan State University. After successfully completing the program and working as an editor of the college paper, she was not able to secure get a work and visa sponsorship after her OPT (Optional Practical Training) period, which one year for non-STEM fields. “I did internships, worked for a newsroom, covered midterm elections, so I was confident that I would get a visa sponsorship. However, nobody was ready to sponsor my work visa,” said Chhabra.</p>
    <p>Wali Khan, a journalism undergraduate from Singapore, worked as an investigative journalist in his home country before enrolling in Michigan State University. He said the only option for international students to gain work experience is to accept an underpaid position. “I work part time, what offered to me was $10-12 per hour. You earn more at Target. It is exceedingly challenging work. When they say 20 hours a week it is not actually 20 hours, you work more,” said Khan.</p>
    <p>However, there are some lucky or extraordinary talented journalism graduates who find jobs and build careers in the U.S. Kai Teoh, a Data, and Interactive News Editor in the Dallas Morning News, graduated from St. Cloud State University in 2012. Since then, he has changed multiple times his work and nonimmigrant visa. “Being an international or immigrant journalist in the US is extremely hard. Every time you change your job you must apply for a visa,” said Teoh.</p>
  
    <p>Many international graduates complain how the visa system is complicated and how employers may not be aware of the process. Graduates and job seekers are responsible for being educated on the policy. “I have been two times on an H visa. Then I worked with an O-1 visa and now I am on an O-1A visa,” said Teoh.</p>
    <p>One of the major visa tracking websites https://www.myvisajobs.com shows that Bloomberg, LP is the first company to offer jobs to immigrants in the field. The company has filed 1496 labor conditions for H-1B visa in the 2020-2021 fiscal year that includes applications that are denials and withdrawn. However, most of those jobs are tech related specializations with only 15 reporters sponsored for H-1B work visa. According to https://www.myvisajobs.com media outlets are not even among the first 200 employers who sponsor visas. The big companies such as CNN ranked in the lower range of sponsoring visas and all their visas were provided to JavaScript developers and other tech specialists, not journalists.</p>
    <p>Few US universities designated humanitarian departments including journalism colleges as STEM specializations. This enables not only international students but citizens to insecure jobs with fewer obstacles. Countries such as Australia and Canada have different relations with the US regarding relatively employment requirements.</p>
    <p>A sport anchor of KVIA ABC-7 News in Texas Rachel Phillips is from Australia, and she works with E-3 visa which is specific for Australian nationals. “Compared to other internationals I do not have many challenges because I work with E-3 visa. But I do have colleagues from here in the south who face job authorization obstacles,” said Phillips. Additionally, Australian nationals like UK nationals have less language and cultural barriers to navigate. “The E-3 classification applies only to nationals of Australia. You must be coming to the United States solely to perform services in a specialty occupation,” said on www.uscis.gov.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">OPT</h2>
    <p>Optional Practical Training is a period when international graduates can work without a visa after their program at college. STEM majors have 12 months of OPT, that can be extended by another 24 months (about 2 years). Non-STEM majors have only a 12-month OPT opportunity. Many non-STEM professionals complain that the less privileged 12-month OPT period is not enough to prove themselves at work further to get H-1B work visa from an employer who wants to sponsor it for you.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">Nonimmigrant Visa Types</h2>
    <p>There are several US nonimmigrant visa types. However, H-1B and O-1 are the most common contemporary work visas to work in your occupation. STEM categorization stands for - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, is not without challenges, however, the US along with other developed countries prioritizes having STEM professionals from overseas.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">O-1</h2>
    <p>O-1 work visa is for individuals with extraordinary ability or achievements in the field and it also temporarily allows immigrants to work. Its period of stay is also up to three years with possibility of extension. USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) defines “extraordinary ability” as a person who should have widespread and sustained acclaim with national or international recognition. O-1 can be sponsored both by employer and candidate. Kai Teoh was lucky to find a company who was ready to sponsor his O-1 when his H-1B period was running out of time. “I worked for different projects, spoke at conferences, helped other journalists at training events and presented at community events as well. All of that went to my O-1 package,” shared Teoh the experience.</p>
    
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">H-1B</h2>
    <p>This visa allows nonimmigrant employees to work for up to three years in a specialty occupation, services of exceptional merit and ability relating to a Department of Defense cooperative research or art (www.uscis.gov). There is a yearly limit for 65,000 visas and another 20,000 petitions for people with master’s degree or higher from the US. One of the requirements is at least a relevant bachelor’s degree or equivalent.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center display-5 my-5">International Students Flow to the U.S.</h2>
    <p>In 2020-2021 academic year, after the pandemic almost 950 thousand international students were studying in the United States by half whose 46% was in humanitarian fields. In 46% of non-STEM fields, journalism’s part is 2%. Even if international students’ proportion is only less than 5% in overall college students they are considered as major contributors to universities’ funds since they mostly pay full tuition fees. Their financial contribution to the U.S. economy was $45 billion (about $140 per person in the US) in 2018 (iie.org) by making 28% of entire revenue at some universities. International students come from 200 different countries across the world and the first countries who send most students are India and China. Students from China and India are 50% of all international students studying at U.S. universities. Mostly, they come with F or J student visas which are much easier to obtain than work visas. It is not even a pathway to citizenship, yet it is temporary permission to work in your field.</p>
    <p>A professor at Michigan State University Journalism School Joe Grimm, former recruiter of Detroit Free Press said international journalists were around 5% of all candidates for journalistic positions. Huge megapolises and big news organizations are considered to have more diverse staff than newsrooms in suburban areas. However, diversity measurements do not track international professionals’ part in newsrooms while it looks racial, ethnic, gender, age, and sexual orientation areas. According to Pew Research, in 2022 52% of surveyed journalists said their organization does not have enough racial and ethnic diversity when 32% said it does.</p>
